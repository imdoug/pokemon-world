Play the eternal "Who's that Pokemon?"

"Who's That Pokémon?" is the English dubbed version of the question-and-answer segments titled だれだ？ (Who is it?), in which a silhouette of each Pokémon is presented and the viewer needs to guess the Pokémon from the silhouette. Oftentimes, it will be a Pokémon featured in the episode, however it will sometimes be randomized.
